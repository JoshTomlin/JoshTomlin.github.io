I am a mathematics PhD student at the University of Adelaide. I am working with Dr David Baraglia in Seiberg-Witten equations of 4-manifold families. I graduated from ANU in December 2019 with first class honours in mathematics. My honours studied surgery on contact manifolds and was supervised by Dr Joan Licata.
