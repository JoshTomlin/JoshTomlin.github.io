I am a mathematics student looking to undertake a PhD. I graduated from ANU in December 2019 with first class honours in mathematics. My honours studied surgery on contact manifolds and was supervised by Dr Joan Licata. 

Here are links to my thesis and final honours talk:

I have been a mathematics workshop demonstrator at the ANU since March 2018. In the past two years the courses I have tutored are:

*   [MATH1005 - Discrete Mathematical Models](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/MATH1005){:target="_blank"}
*   [MATH1013 - Mathematics and Applications 1](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/MATH1013){:target="_blank"}
*   [MATH2222 - Introduction to Mathematical Thinking: Problem-Solving and Proofs](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/MATH2222){:target="_blank"}
*   [MATH1113 - Mathematical Foundations for Actuarial Studies](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/MATH1113){:target="_blank"}

Here is a link to my [Student Experience of Learning & Teaching review](./MATH2222_SELT.pdf){:target="_blank"} for MATH2222.
