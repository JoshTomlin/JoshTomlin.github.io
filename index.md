I am an Associate Lecturer and researcher at the University of Adelaide. Currently, I coordinate the course [PURE MTH 3019 - Complex Analysis III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/103236/1/sem-2/){:target="_blank"}. I have recently submitted my PhD thesis for examination and am expecting to graduate in December 2025. I worked with Dr David Baraglia on Seiberg-Witten theory for 4-manifold families. 

I completed my undergradute at ANU in 2019 with first class honours in mathematics. My honours studied surgery on contact 3-manifolds and was supervised by Dr Joan Licata. 

Here are links to my thesis and final honours talk:

Since 2018, I have been a Workshop Demonstrator for various undergraduate courses at both UoA and ANU. Below are some of  my Student Experience of Learning and Teaching reviews with student comments about my teaching:
