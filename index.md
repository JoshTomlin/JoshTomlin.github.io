I am an Associate Lecturer and researcher at the University of Adelaide. Currently, I coordinate the course [PURE MTH 3019 - Complex Analysis III](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/103236/1/sem-2/){:target="_blank"}. I have recently received my PhD from the University of Adelaide with commendation from the Dean for doctoral thesis excellence. I worked with Dr. David Baraglia on Seiberg-Witten theory for 4-manifold families. Below are links to my thesis and two of my papers.

I completed my undergradute at the Australian National University in 2019 with first class honours in mathematics. My honours studied surgery on contact 3-manifolds and was supervised by Prof. Joan Licata. Here are links to my thesis and final honours talk:

Since 2018, I have been a Workshop Demonstrator for various undergraduate courses at both the University of Adelaide and the Australian National University. Below are some of my Student Experience of Learning and Teaching reviews with student feedback about my teaching:
